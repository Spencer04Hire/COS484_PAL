How many more baseball cards than Ace cards does Nell have?", "target": 266.0, "answer": "-47", "score": 0, "generation": ["Nell originally had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards. After giving some cards to Jeff, she has a total of 415 cards left. To find out how many cards she has left of each type, we first need to determine how many cards she gave away.\n\nOriginally, she had 309 + 356 = 665 cards. After giving some away, she has 415 cards left. Therefore, she gave away 665 - 415 = 250 cards.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many baseball and Ace cards she has left. Let\u2019s denote the number of baseball cards she has left as \\( x \\) and the number of Ace cards as \\( y \\). We know that:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 415 \\) (total cards left)\n2. \\( x = 309 - a \\) (where \\( a \\) is the number of baseball cards given away)\n3. \\( y = 356 - b \\) (where \\( b \\) is the number of Ace cards given away)\n\nSince \\( a + b = 250 \\) (the total number of cards given away), we can express \\( b \\) in terms of \\( a \\):\n\n\\( b = 250 - a \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( b \\) into the second equation gives us:\n\n\\( x + (356 - (250 - a)) = 415 \\)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\( x + 356 - 250 + a = 415 \\)\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n\\( x + a + 106 = 415 \\)\n\nThus:\n\n\\( x + a = 309 \\)\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 415 \\)\n2. \\( x + a = 309 \\)\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express \\( y \\) as:\n\n\\( y = 415 - x \\)\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation gives us:\n\n\\( x + a = 309 \\)\n\nNow we can find the difference between the number of baseball cards and Ace cards:\n\nThe number of baseball cards left is \\( x \\) and the number of Ace cards left is \\( y \\). \n\nTo find how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has, we calculate:\n\n\\( x - y = x - (415 - x) = 2x - 415 \\)\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we can use the total cards left:\n\nSince we know she had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards originally, we can assume she gave away some of each type. However, we need to find the difference directly.\n\nSince we don't have the exact numbers of cards given away, we can only conclude that the difference in the number of cards is:\n\n\\( 309 - 356 = -47 \\)\n\nThis means she originally had 47 fewer baseball cards than Ace cards. After giving away cards, we cannot determine the exact difference without knowing how many of each type she gave away.\n\nHowever, if we assume she gave away cards proportionally, we can conclude that the difference remains the same.\n\nThus, the answer to how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has is:\n\nA:\n-47"]}
